      "Joe grew up working with his hands in Wilmington, NC. After years of working for other contractors and seeing too many corners cut, he decided to do things differently. In 2019, Flytrap Fence Company was born.",
      "The name \"Flytrap\" comes from the Venus flytrap, a plant native to the Wilmington area and found nowhere else in the world. Just like that plant, we're proudly local, deeply rooted in this community, and built to thrive in the Carolina climate.",
      "What started as a one-man operation has grown into a trusted team, but Joe is still on the job site for every install. He believes the owner should know exactly what's going into your fence—because that's the only way to guarantee quality."
    ],
    "highlight": "When Joe's not setting posts, you'll find him fishing in the Cape Fear River, coaching little league, or spending time with his family. He's not just building fences—he's building a business his kids can be proud of."

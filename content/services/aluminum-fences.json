    "title": "Aluminum Fence Questions & Answers",
    "items": [
      {
        "question": "Will aluminum fencing rust in Wilmington's salty, humid air?",
        "answer": "Never. Aluminum is completely rust-proof—it's not just rust-resistant, it physically cannot rust. The powder-coat finish adds an extra layer of protection against scratches and environmental exposure. This makes aluminum ideal for coastal Carolina properties where salt air quickly corrodes steel and iron."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is aluminum fencing strong enough for security?",
        "answer": "Yes. While aluminum is lighter than steel, our residential-grade aluminum fencing is plenty strong for securing yards, pools, and pets. For commercial applications or enhanced security needs, we install commercial-grade aluminum with thicker walls and heavier-duty construction."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does aluminum fencing meet pool code requirements?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. We install aluminum pool fencing that meets all North Carolina pool barrier codes. This includes minimum 4-foot height (we typically recommend 5 feet), non-climbable design, maximum 4-inch picket spacing, and self-closing/self-latching gates with locks. We'll ensure your fence passes inspection."
      },
      {
        "question": "What colors are available for aluminum fencing?",
        "answer": "Standard colors include black (most popular), bronze, white, and sometimes hunter green. These colors are powder-coated—baked on for durability—not painted. Custom colors are available from most manufacturers for an additional charge if you need to match specific architectural elements."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does aluminum compare to wrought iron?",
        "answer": "Aluminum offers the same elegant look as wrought iron without the drawbacks. It never rusts, never needs painting, costs less, weighs less (easier installation), and requires zero maintenance. The only advantage of true wrought iron is marginally greater strength, which is rarely needed for residential applications."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can aluminum fencing be used for pet containment?",
        "answer": "Yes, with appropriate specifications. Standard aluminum fencing works well for larger dogs. For small dogs, puppies, or cats, we recommend 'puppy picket' styles with closer spacing at the bottom. We'll discuss your pets' specific needs during the consultation and recommend appropriate solutions."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does aluminum fencing last?",
        "answer": "With the powder-coat finish, aluminum fencing easily lasts 30+ years—often a lifetime. There's no rust, no rot, and minimal wear. Most manufacturers offer warranties of 20 years or more on the finish, and lifetime warranties on the aluminum itself."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is aluminum fencing more expensive than other options?",
        "answer": "Aluminum falls in the mid-to-upper price range, typically more than chain link and wood but comparable to vinyl. However, its zero-maintenance nature and exceptional lifespan make it very cost-effective over time. For pool areas especially, aluminum is often the best value when you consider longevity and code compliance."

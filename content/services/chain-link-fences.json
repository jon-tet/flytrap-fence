    "title": "Chain Link Fence Questions & Answers",
    "items": [
      {
        "question": "How long does chain link fencing last?",
        "answer": "With galvanized coating, chain link fencing typically lasts 20-25 years in Wilmington's coastal climate. Vinyl-coated chain link can last even longer—30+ years—due to the additional layer of corrosion protection. With minimal maintenance, your chain link fence will provide decades of reliable service."
      },
      {
        "question": "What gauge wire should I choose?",
        "answer": "For residential applications, 11.5 gauge wire is standard and sufficient for most needs. If you have large dogs, need extra security, or want maximum durability, we recommend 9 gauge. Commercial and industrial applications often use 6 gauge for heavy-duty security. We'll recommend the appropriate gauge during your consultation."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can you add privacy to chain link fencing?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. Privacy slats insert vertically into the chain link mesh, providing 70-90% privacy coverage depending on the style. Slats are available in various colors including green, tan, brown, black, and white. They also reduce wind and can extend the life of your fence by reducing stress on the mesh."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is chain link fencing good for dogs?",
        "answer": "Chain link is one of the best choices for dog containment. The tight mesh prevents dogs from squeezing through, and the visibility lets you monitor your pet while they're outside. For diggers, we can install bottom tension wire or bury the mesh slightly below grade. For jumpers, we install heights up to 8 feet or add deterrent extensions."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does chain link work for pool enclosures?",
        "answer": "Yes, with the proper specifications. We install chain link pool fencing that meets North Carolina pool barrier codes, including minimum 4-foot height, self-closing/self-latching gates, and proper mesh size to prevent climbing. Black vinyl-coated chain link is a popular, budget-friendly pool fence option."
      },
      {
        "question": "How quickly can chain link be installed?",
        "answer": "Chain link installs faster than any other fence type. Most residential projects (100-300 linear feet) complete in a single day. Larger commercial installations may take 2-3 days. This quick installation means lower labor costs and less disruption to your property."
      },
      {
        "question": "What maintenance does chain link require?",
        "answer": "Very little. Chain link is essentially maintenance-free. Occasionally rinse off dirt and debris with a hose. Check gate hardware periodically and lubricate hinges once a year. That's it. No painting, staining, or treatments required—ever."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can chain link be installed on uneven ground?",
        "answer": "Yes. Chain link actually handles slopes and uneven terrain better than rigid panel fencing. The flexible mesh can follow the contour of your land while still maintaining a secure enclosure. We'll assess your terrain and recommend the best approach during the site visit."

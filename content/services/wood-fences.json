    "title": "Wood Fence Questions & Answers",
    "items": [
      {
        "question": "How long does a wood fence last in Wilmington's coastal climate?",
        "answer": "With proper installation and maintenance, a pressure-treated wood fence in the Wilmington area typically lasts 15-20 years. Our installation techniques—including deep concrete post settings and elevated bottom rails—help protect against the moisture and humidity common in coastal North Carolina. Cedar fences can last even longer, often 20-25 years, due to their natural rot resistance."
      },
      {
        "question": "What type of wood do you recommend for fences in the Wilmington area?",
        "answer": "We primarily use pressure-treated Southern Yellow Pine for its excellent durability and value in our coastal climate. The treatment process protects against rot, insects, and fungal decay. For customers seeking premium aesthetics and natural rot resistance, we also offer Western Red Cedar, which weathers to a beautiful silver-gray patina over time."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I need to seal or stain my new wood fence?",
        "answer": "We recommend waiting 3-6 months after installation to allow the wood to dry and cure properly before applying any sealant or stain. After that initial period, applying a quality water-repellent sealant or semi-transparent stain every 2-3 years will significantly extend your fence's lifespan and maintain its appearance. We're happy to provide product recommendations."
      },
      {
        "question": "How tall can I build my wood fence in Wilmington?",
        "answer": "Most residential areas in Wilmington, Leland, and Hampstead allow 6-foot fences in backyards and 4-foot fences in front yards without special permits. However, regulations vary by municipality and HOA. During our consultation, we'll verify the specific requirements for your property and handle any necessary permitting."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the difference between board-on-board and a regular privacy fence?",
        "answer": "A standard privacy fence (stockade style) has pickets nailed to one side of the rails, leaving the rail structure visible from the opposite side. Board-on-board fencing alternates pickets on both sides of the rails, eliminating gaps and creating a finished appearance from both directions. It costs slightly more but provides better privacy and a more attractive 'good neighbor' look."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does wood fence installation take?",
        "answer": "Most residential wood fence installations take 1-3 days depending on the total linear footage and complexity. A typical 150-200 linear foot backyard fence is usually completed in 1-2 days. We'll provide a specific timeline during your quote consultation."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can you install a wood fence on sloped or uneven ground?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. We have extensive experience installing fences on the varied terrain throughout the Wilmington area. For slopes, we can either 'rack' the fence (angling each section to follow the grade) or 'step' it (creating level sections that stair-step down the slope). We'll recommend the best approach for your specific property during the consultation."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's included in your 5-year workmanship warranty?",
        "answer": "Our warranty covers defects in installation workmanship including post failure, leaning sections, gate operation issues, and structural problems not caused by external damage or neglect. If any issue arises from our installation work within 5 years, we'll repair it at no cost to you. This warranty is transferable if you sell your home."

    "title": "Vinyl Fence Questions & Answers",
    "items": [
      {
        "question": "How does vinyl fencing hold up in hurricane season?",
        "answer": "Quality vinyl fencing is engineered to withstand severe weather. The premium vinyl we install is rated for winds up to 110 mph when properly installed. The flexibility of vinyl actually helps it survive high winds—it can flex without breaking. We also set posts deep in concrete (minimum 2 feet) for maximum wind resistance."
      },
      {
        "question": "Will vinyl fencing turn yellow or fade in the sun?",
        "answer": "Not with quality vinyl. The fencing we install contains titanium dioxide UV inhibitors that prevent yellowing and fading. These aren't surface coatings that wear off—they're engineered into the material itself. Most manufacturers back this with warranties of 20 years or more against fading."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is vinyl fencing more expensive than wood?",
        "answer": "Vinyl has a higher upfront cost—typically 30-50% more than comparable wood fencing. However, when you factor in the cost of staining, sealing, and repairs over a wood fence's lifetime (approximately $500-1,500 every 2-3 years), vinyl often proves more economical over the long term. Plus, you never spend another weekend on fence maintenance."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can vinyl fencing be installed on slopes?",
        "answer": "Yes, but with some considerations. Vinyl fence panels can be stepped down slopes (like stair steps) to follow grade changes. Racking (angling panels) is limited with vinyl due to its rigid panel construction. During your consultation, we'll assess your terrain and recommend the best approach."
      },
      {
        "question": "What colors and styles are available?",
        "answer": "We offer vinyl fencing in classic white, almond/tan, clay/gray, and several woodgrain textures that replicate cedar, walnut, and other natural wood tones. Styles range from privacy and semi-privacy panels to picket fences and ranch rails. We'll bring samples to your consultation so you can see the options firsthand."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I clean my vinyl fence?",
        "answer": "That's the beauty of vinyl—it requires almost no maintenance. For general cleaning, simply rinse with a garden hose. For stubborn dirt, mildew, or stains, a mixture of water and mild dish soap with a soft brush works perfectly. Avoid abrasive cleaners or pressure washers on high settings."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can vinyl fencing be repaired if damaged?",
        "answer": "Yes. Most vinyl fence systems are modular, meaning individual pickets, panels, or rails can be replaced without disturbing the rest of the fence. However, damage is rare—vinyl doesn't rot, splinter, or deteriorate like wood. The most common cause of vinyl fence damage is impact (vehicles, falling trees, etc.)."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does vinyl fencing meet pool code requirements?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. We install vinyl pool fencing that meets all North Carolina pool barrier codes, including proper height (minimum 4 feet), non-climbable design, and self-closing/self-latching gate requirements. We'll ensure your fence passes inspection."
